<h2>Topic 1: Work and careers</h2>
<h3>Some employers offer their employees subsidised membership of gyms and sports clubs, believing that this will make their staff healthier and thus more effective at work. Other employers see no benefit in doing so.		Consider the arguments from both aspects of this possible debate, and reach a conclusion.
</h3>
<p>
Employers are always seeking ways to enhance their employee's productivity , and subsidising healthy pursuits may be once way of archieving this. There are arguments on both sides, however, which will be discusssed here.
</br>On the one hand, it might be said that if workers are fitter and less stressed, their working time will be more efficient, leading to higher leverls of outpouts and service. furthermore, the work'life balance of the staff will hopefully be improved, because their leisure time will be more fulfilling. This may even be more motivating than pay increaments, perks, or finacial rewards such as bonuses or incentives which maybe hard to attain. Finally, feeling healthier may lead to better job satisfaction which is in itself a motivating factor.
</br>
Conversely, the problem with such leisure-based subsidies is that their efficacy is virtually impossible to quantify. For example, with target-related payments, employers can at least see whether the objecives are reached or not. It might also be said that, if this budget was spent on (for instance) on the job training or day release programmes, the employees would achieve better career progression and have better job prospects. These matters are all easier to measure, especially in performance reviews and appraisals, and may evern help to reduce the risk of redundancy if the company restructures, downsizes or outsources its workforce.
Overall, it seems that, while healthy-related subsidies are superficially attractive, the lack of measurability is a substantial drawback. Spending funds on ongoing training would appear to be a better use of company or Human resources budgets.

<h2>Topic 2: Education and schooling</h2>
<h3>"The Internet will never replace traditional course books in schools."
	How far do you agree with this prediction?
</h3>
<p>
There is a huge range of resources available to the modern teacher, and the right selection is crucial in delivering effective lessons. I agree that there will always be a place for course books in the school curriculum, despite the many benefits of the Internet.
</br>
Firstly, course books (whether conventional or digital) have been developed by pedagogical experts and designed to be incorporated into a subject syllabus, leading to testing procedures such as formal examinations or continuous assessment. This means that they are proven to improve students' academics achievement, enhancing their potential for progression to futher or higher education. Furthermore, the use of modern course books allows pupils to coordinate their studies as part of group work, hopefully making their lessions less teacher-led and more about autonomous learning. This in itself teaches study skills such as independent research and synthesising sources rather than old-fashioned rote-learning. This is where the Internet, in fact, can play a useful part: to suplement and add to knowledge which the students are assimilating via their course books.
However, it is the role of teachers and school management generally to ensure that use of the Internet remains a guided learning process, and not an excercise in data-gathering from Internet sources which may be unreliable or even misleading.
</br>
It is true that the Internet can be invaluable for adults (for example in distance learning or self-study modules) who are able to discriminate between sources and sift information to marshal their facts. However, this is a mature skill and we should not assume that school age pupils are ready to do this.
</br>
Overall, it appears that course books, with their quality and depth of material, are set to remain an integral part of the syllabus. The internet can be judged a useful supplement to this, if used carefully and under supervision.

<h2>Topic 3: Children and families</h2>
<h3>Some people believe that children should spend all of their free time with their families. Others believe that this is unnecessary or even negative. Discuss the possible arguments on both	sides, and say which side you personally support.
</h3>
<p>
Nobody can deny that parental influence is important for children, at least in cases where children live with their parents, foster parents or guardians. However, it is by no means clear that children should spend time exclusively in the family, as we will see.
</br>
On the one hand, it may appear advisable for parents to act as role models and to establish ground rules for behavior by spending as much time as possible with their children. This allows the youngsters to absorb conventions and codes of conduct which they can then follow themselves, hopefully leading to an absence of problems such as bullying, truancy and delingquency later on. Furthermore, being with the family should reduce the risk of children failing victim to crimes such as abduction, or coming under the influence of negative peer pressure.
</br>
On the other hand, we have to ask whether this is a practical proposition. In a society where many families are dual-income, or where on parent's role as breadwinner means he/she is away from the family for long periods, it is inevitable that children cannot spend all of their time with the family. Child-minding and after-school childcare are often used in these cases , and if managed properly, these can be perfectly viable alternatives. Equally, it seems that children can in some cases learn a considerable amount from their peers in addition to adults, and following them to play without direct supervision may be a benefit.
</br>
To conclude, it appears that, while family time is essential for bonding and absorbing patterns of behavior; there are definite advantages when children are outside the family too. This is provided that they are in a safe, wwll-behaved environment with peers who are themselves reasonable well brought-up.

<h2>
	Topic 4: Nature, the environment and energy
</h2>
<h3>
	Polution of rives, lakes and seas is a major concern for people who seek the environemnt. What are the possible causes of water pollution, and what effects does this have on animal life and human society?
</h3>
<p>
In this topic remember to show that you can write in an impersonal, academic way even if you feel strongly about something. Remember that emotional words such as terrible, shocking, disgusting or wonderful, fantastic, brilliant cannot be used in Academic essays of this type.
</br> You can use Academic English such as: regretable, worrying inadvisable or admirable.
</br> This is an Ideas/Causes/effects type task. It does not ask for your opinion, but it wants you to think of some possible ideas on the topic. You should introduce the topic, describe two or three causes,then two or three effects, and then summarise briefly.
</p>

<p>
	Water contamination is a serious form of polution, and one that can be challenging to rectify. There seems to be two main causes involved, and a variety of damaging effects on people and the biosphere, which we will discuss here.
	</br> Probably the main factor is the issue of emissions from factories, cars and other human activities. These emissions contain damaging pollutant particles which can contaminate rainwater run-off and thus enter the water cycle, by transferring through the water table into aquifers (aquifer /'ækwifə/ danh từ (địa lý,địa chất) lớp ngậm nước, tầng ngậm nước), streams and rivers. Filtration and processing are not really viable options for such large volumes of water, and so the water table remains tainted with these elements over long periods, as we see in Eastern Europe today. In situations where soil erosion and logging have already damaged the local environment, the accumulation can be very serious. The other major cause is accidental or deliverate dumping of waste products in places outside of controlled landfills or waste processing centres. Even small amounts of abandoned waste can enter water supplies trhough the ground, often undetected.
	</br>  The effects on animal life can be severe, especially for species which are already endangered by such threats as poaching (câu trộm), habitat loss and food chain disruption. Contaminated water can lead to dwindling numbers (/'dwind/ nội động từ: nhỏ lại, thu nhỏ lại, teo đi, co lại ) or even potential extinction, as may indeed happen to the Asian tiger populations. The impact on human society can also be distressing, including the poisoning of drinking water, famine or drought due to lack of safe irrigation (/,iri'geiʃn/ danh từ: sự tưới (đất, ruộng); sự tưới cho tươi tốt; tình trạng được tưới (y học) sự rửa (vết thương)), and long-term loss of land as we see, for example, after the Bhopal poisoning catastrophe in India. Such effects tend to have an especially grave impact on the very poorest in society, with the least resources to counter the environmental effects.
	</br> Overall, we see that emissions and dumping are the main origins of the problem, and that the effects on both humans and animals are exacerbated by the exisiting environmental, criminal or social problems. (exacerbate /eks'æsə:beit/ (acerbate) /'æsəbeit/ ngoại động từ: làm tăng, làm trầm trọng (bệnh, sự tức giận, sự đau đớn) làm bực tức, làm cáu tiết, làm tức giận)

<h2>Topic 5: Culture, art and traditions</h2>
<h3>
	In many countries, traditional dress and costumes are considered effective ways of maintaining links with the past. How effective can traditional costumes be, in this sense?	What other ways exist to help citizens connect with a country’s past?
</h3>
<p>
	The Culture, art and traditions topic includes human folklore, ceremonies and rituals, myths
and legends, social customs, traditional languages, dress and arts, the impact of modern life on
traditional lifestyles and differences in national habits.
</br>Please remember that IELTS will not ask specifically about religion, politics or spiritual
beliefs, and you should not base your answers in the Writing or Speaking tests on your personal
beliefs in these areas. For example, if the Task asks whether you agree with a certain idea, you would
get a low mark if you say ‘Yes, because my religion agrees with it/ because my President has this
policy’ or similar.
</br>You can certainly use religious or political situations as evidence or examples to support an
argument, but not as a starting point. For example, ‘We should give money to charity because it
benefits society, as we can see for example in countries where religious observance requires
people to do this regularly.’ This is a more logical and academic way to respond
</p>
<p>
Explanation of the Task
</br>This is an Ideas/Evaluate type essay.
</br>It does not ask for your opinion about whether costumes are good or bad, but it asks for you to
decide whether these costumes are effective (or not effective) ways of maintaining links with the past,
and to suggest other ways of connecting to the past. You should say how effective costumes are, with
examples and evidence, and then compare their effectiveness to some other possible ways of
connecting to the past.
</br>Remember that ‘Ideas/Evaluate’ means that you should compare things in the way that they are
used in society, but not decide on your personal preference about these things.
</p>

<p>
	Most people would agree that preserding connectios with our psst is an admirable obective, especially as the world evolves o rapidly. I feel that traditional costumes are one part of doing this, but they are by no means the most important, as we shall see.
</br> Admittedly, historic dress plays a key role in social events such as religious rituals or military parades, and these events are helpful in transmitting socieal memes such as public duty and self-sacrifice. Traditional costumes also remind us of the origins of cultural traditions and mythologies, for instance the historic Swiss national dress which evokes their medieval independent.
</br> However, it must be said that costumes are an accessory in these situtaions, and do not appear to constitue the central message. It is the ceremonies themselves which convey the cultural norms that help to maintain the fabric of society. In this sense, the costumes are o secondary importance. Furthermroe, it seems that there are infact much more powerful ways in which culture is conserved and handed down between the generations.
Most countries have a rich heritage of legens and folklore about the birth and development of their nation, some of which are mythological and some being grounded in truth ( as we see the English stories about Robin hood or George and the Dragon, for example.) These stories are a cultural inheritance which embodies improtant symbols and concepts far more effectively than dress. Similarly, we must remember the significance of art and music in passing on our traditions, in forms ranging from fine art to handicrafts, and from opera to traditional shaties and dirges. The presence of visual or linguistic messages in these media make them more effective than costumes, which convey no language.
</br> Overall, we must recognise and welcome the use of traditional dress in helping to maintain our cultures. However, the forms of story, art and music would appear to be the driving forces in this invaluable porcess.

	Topic 6: Healthcare, health and sport
</h2>
<h3>
	Many doctors are concerned about the high use of computer games by children and young people. What mental and physical problems may arise from excessive use of these games? How could thse problems be reduced?
</h3>
<p>
	It doesn not ask about whether computer games are good or not, but about your ideas regarding possible mental and physical problems due to excessive use, and also any solutions that you can think of. 
	</br> you should introduce the topic, describe two or three problems, then two or three solutions, and then summarise. Notice that the Task asks about mental and physical problems, so you should say something on each type of problem.
</p>
<p>
Children appear to enjoy playing video games, and while there are undoubted benefits, various nagative effects stem from this too. Let us consider the main issues, and then outline possible remedies.
	</br> Perhaps the major physical problem is the desentary lifestyle which these games encourage, meaning that youngsters may incline to obesity or inadequate development. Added to this is the strain on eyesight resulting from excessive use of screens and consoles, meaning the children may suffer symtomps of poor vision. There are also concerns about impairment of reflexes due to the repetitive nature of the hand muscles when playing these games, and about the poor diet of convenience food which often accompanies this lifestyle.
	</br> The most alarming psychological impact of such activities is possibly the risk of addiction, meaning the children become obsessed with the games and are unable to socialise with family or peers. This undermines their interpersonal skills and makes them underperform both academically and socially.
	</br> Turning to possible solutions, perhaps the immediate step would be to promote a more active lifestyle through exercise regimes or sports programmes which would help to detoxify the lifestyles of chilren affected. This could be done trhough sponsorship of sprots, or participation in competitive events such as races or matches, hopefully ameliorating the physical effects of excessive games use. Potential remedies for the danger of mental addiction maybe, firstly, an initiative to raise awareness of the risks of the situation, for example throught health wwarnings on games packaging or through high-profile spokespersons spreading such a message. For example, if sports champions or figure heads speak out about these dangers, the message may well get through to children.
	</br> To sum up, the risks posed by excessive gaming are connected to an unhealthy lifestyle and the possibility of dependency on the activity. Possible answers might involve stronger education about the dangers and the health benefits of more active pursuits.

</h2>
<h3>
	"Unemployement remains the biggest challenge to school-leavers in most countires". How far do you agree with this assessment? What other challenges face young people today?
</h3>
<p>
	</br> It asks how far you agree with an idea. You should introduce the topic and give your opinion in the instruction, then explain why you have this view. You should briefly condiser the opposing view, then restate your opinion in the conclusion. This particular Task has an extra element, which sometimes haooens in Task 2: it asks you to suggest some other challenge also. You should combine these ideas in the main body of the essay.
</p>
<p>
	Youth unemployment is certainly a worrying challenge for most countries, especially at a time of economic instability and social unrest. However, to say that this is the largest issue is to overlook a range of equally pressing matters, as we will discuss now.
	</br> It must be admitted that joblessness can undermine a young person's economic prospects and consequent social mobility. Nevertheless, this issue can be ameliorated (/ə'mi:ljəreit/) by coordinated action between the state and the private sector, as we have seen, for instance, in Canada recently. When this is realized, we can see that other concerns are at least as serious.
	</br> Foremost among these is perhaps the issue of age demographics, whereby young people bear the burden for an increasingly elderly population with high longevity. This means that young people will pay higher taxes and work longer hours, possibly forcing them to migrate to countries where this pressure is lower. The effect of this is the "brain drain" situation which can be seen in southern Europe, where young, ambitious people prefer to leave their countries altogether, exacerbating (/eks'æsə:beit/) the problem for those remaining.
	</br> Furthermore, we must remember that a substantial propotion of young people globally face existantial threats such as famine (/'fæmin/), drought or outbreaks of disease. These problems are often caused by (or are compounded by) civil war, political instability (/,instə'biliti/) or the corruption of people in power locally. Such risks are a danger to their safety in addition to their livelihood, and so would appear to be far more serious than unemployment.
	</br> To conclude, it seems logical to accept that joblessness is a major challenge for young people. However, persitent trends in demographics among developed countries and the presence of physical dangers in developing contries should be regarded as at least as severe.

<h2>
	Topic 8: Cities and infrastructure
</h2>
<h3>
	Transport delays and long journey times are a widespread phenomenon in many cities today. What are the causes of this problem, and how could the situation be improved?
</h3>
<p>
	</br>
</p>
<p>
	Transport is an essential part of urban life, and lengthy journeys are frustating and expensive for those concerned. There appear to be two main causes of this, and several posible solutions, as we will explain here.
	</br> Perhaps the main cause is the lack of investment or funding for infrastructure in the form of high-capacity public transport and increased road space for private vehicles. This means that too many vehicles use the existing network, and congestion is inevitable. We see this in most large cities globally, such as London or tokyo. Many conurbations also lack finance for transport hubs, such as integrated road and rail facilities which could connect public and private transport, thus reducing bottlenecks. A further cause seems to be the problem of overcrowding in cities, whereby people migrate from the hinterland and settle in urban areas, putting strain on amenities, housing and above all on transport capacity. This means that an already stretched  system is often pushed to a critical point, causing cancellations and breakdowns in the technology used, especially in situations of urban sprawl such as Latin America.
	</br> Regarding potential solutions, probably the main remedy would be to encourage investment in better infrastructure, for example through subsidies or public-private partnerships as was tried successfully in Germany during the 1990's. This enhances the network and fosters a sense of civic pride, to everyone's benefit. Another solution may be to use tax incentives to allow more home working, so that there is less need to commute from the suburbs to the inner city for work. A final response might be the development of more flexible patterns of transport, such as communal carpooling, which would reduce reliance on existing systems and vehicles.
	</br> In conclusion, it seems that outdated infrastructure and overcrowding are the key factors behind our transport frustations. Possible solutions would involve better funding, and also innovations in ways of working and travelling to reduce the burden on the system.

	Topic 9: Countryside and agriculture
</h2>
<h3>
	It is sometimes said that the counryside offers a high quality of life, especially for families. What are the arguments for and against families choosing to live and work in the countryside, for example as farmers? What is your own view about this?
</h3>
<p>
	</br>
</p>
<p>
	There can be few choices in life more important than where to settle as a family, and the question of an urban or rural location is complex. There are strong arguments for and against living in the countryside, as we will discuss now.
	</br> On the one hand, it might be said that the countryside is rather a backwater, with fewer cultural amenites than a city in the form of museums, theaters and even sporting events. This may mean that families become isolated, especially as rural depopulation leaves fewer country dwellers in the area, as we see, for example, in central France. Added to this is the scarity of schools and colleges, meaning that children may need to travel long distances for their education. finally, career options may be more limited in the countryside for both parents and children, resulting in rural unemployement and long-term rural poverty in the worst cases.
	</br> Conversely, life in the countryside has rewards which go beyond material considerations. for example, the abundance of natural resources such as land, wildlife forestry and water bodies means that a comparatively simple life can be lived at a subsistence level. Many country residents are self-sufficient samllholders in this sense, safeguarding them from the changes in the wider economy which can afflict city dwellers. If the parents are farmers, children learn the importance of animal husbandry, methods of farming such as crop rotation and irrigation, and generally may become more in tune with the natural world as a result. Finally, as technology enables children to undertake distance learning or remote viewing of cultural attractions such as museums, they should be less isolated from their cultural heritage.
	</br> Overall, it seems to me that quality of life in the countryside today is indeed quite high, with its advantages of resources, self-sufficiency and environmental awareness. This is especially tru now that communications are reducing the risk of isolation in such far-flung communities.

	Topic 10: Government and the authorities
</h2>
<h3>
	Some observers say that police officers should be recruited from the communities where they work, so that the have local knowledge. Other people say that this is unnecessary, or even undesirable. Where do you stand on this debate? Is local knowledge essential in modern policing?
</h3>
<p>
	Law and order, crime and policing, justice and punishment. Occasionally the Task may refeer to ways of managing public services, ans relations between countries. The Task may ask about public policy in terms of funding but will not ask for your political views about actual eveents in specific countries.
	</br>
</p>
<p>
	The need for effective, trustworthy police officers is paramount in society today, especially as criminals become more devious and creative. Regarding whether police should be locally hired, there is a case to be made on both sides of the debate.
	
	</br> Those who support local recruitement of officers point to the need for the police to understand the minutiae of the local community. For example, a community may have certain frictions or a history of a specific grivance, whether religous, political or otherwise. In such situations, the argument goes, the police need to show sensitivity, and also be able to anticipate the kinds of crimes that may be committed. Furthermore, local officers may find it easier to gain informants in the community, leasding to stronger evidence at trials, higher conviction rates and a deterrent to crime throught sentencing, imprisonment, fines or community service leading to rehabilitation of the offender.
	
	</br> On the other hand, it seems likely that officers from the communitiy may in fact share some of the tendencies of the people they grew up with. For example, in countries such as Mexico, we see a high incidence of corruption among the local business and government community which is equalled by bribery among the police. A second objection is that local sensitivity may lead to the police failing to enforce laws fully, and effectively making exceptions for some offenders, which is unequitable towards law-abiding citizens. Finally, we must remember that police officers should have transferable skills, such as latenral thinking and investigative ability, which should transcend their background or the environment they are working with.
	
	</br> Overall, it seems to me that local knowledge is not absolutely essential for the police, whose stills should be effective in any context. Indeed, I agree with those who say that the risks of local recruitment outweigh the benefits, because of danger of corruptions and over-familiarity with potential offenders.
