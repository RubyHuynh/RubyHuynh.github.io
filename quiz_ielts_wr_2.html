<h2>Topic 1: Work and careers</h2>
<h3>Some employers offer their employees subsidised membership of gyms and sports clubs, believing that this will make their staff healthier and thus more effective at work. Other employers see no benefit in doing so.		Consider the arguments from both aspects of this possible debate, and reach a conclusion.
</h3>
<pre>
Employers are always seeking ways to enhance their employee's productivity , and subsidising healthy pursuits may be once way of archieving this. There are arguments on both sides, however, which will be discusssed here.
On the one hand, it might be said that if workers are fitter and less stressed, their working time will be more efficient, leading to higher leverls of outpouts and service. furthermore, the work'life balance of the staff will hopefully be improved, because their leisure time will be more fulfilling. This may even be more motivating than pay increaments, perks, or finacial rewards such as bonuses or incentives which maybe hard to attain. Finally, feeling healthier may lead to better job satisfaction which is in itself a motivating factor.

Conversely, the problem with such leisure-based subsidies is that their efficacy is virtually impossible to quantify. For example, with target-related payments, employers can at least see whether the objecives are reached or not. It might also be said that, if this budget was spent on (for instance) on the job training or day release programmes, the employees would achieve better career progression and have better job prospects. These matters are all easier to measure, especially in performance reviews and appraisals, and may evern help to reduce the risk of redundancy if the company restructures, downsizes or outsources its workforce.
Overall, it seems that, while healthy-related subsidies are superficially attractive, the lack of measurability is a substantial drawback. Spending funds on ongoing training would appear to be a better use of company or Human resources budgets.

<h2>Topic 2: Education and schooling</h2>
<h3>"The Internet will never replace traditional course books in schools."
	How far do you agree with this prediction?
</h3>
<pre>
There is a huge range of resources available to the modern teacher, and the right selection is crucial in delivering effective lessons. I agree that there will always be a place for course books in the school curriculum, despite the many benefits of the Internet.

Firstly, course books (whether conventional or digital) have been developed by pedagogical experts and designed to be incorporated into a subject syllabus, leading to testing procedures such as formal examinations or continuous assessment. This means that they are proven to improve students' academics achievement, enhancing their potential for progression to futher or higher education. Furthermore, the use of modern course books allows pupils to coordinate their studies as part of group work, hopefully making their lessions less teacher-led and more about autonomous learning. This in itself teaches study skills such as independent research and synthesising sources rather than old-fashioned rote-learning. This is where the Internet, in fact, can play a useful part: to suplement and add to knowledge which the students are assimilating via their course books.
However, it is the role of teachers and school management generally to ensure that use of the Internet remains a guided learning process, and not an excercise in data-gathering from Internet sources which may be unreliable or even misleading.

It is true that the Internet can be invaluable for adults (for example in distance learning or self-study modules) who are able to discriminate between sources and sift information to marshal their facts. However, this is a mature skill and we should not assume that school age pupils are ready to do this.

Overall, it appears that course books, with their quality and depth of material, are set to remain an integral part of the syllabus. The internet can be judged a useful supplement to this, if used carefully and under supervision.
