							<h1>
								Ages (a very long time)
							</h1>
							<ol>
								<li>
									I meet your brother quite a bit these days but I haven't seen your sister in/for ages
									</br>
									* In: would only be used after a negative or superlative construction
									* But not in the future. we would not say: we won't arrive in ages.
								</li>
								<li>
									It's seem ages since I was last here.
								</li>
							</ol>
							
							<h1>
								Well off (rich)
							</h1>
							<ol>
								<li>
									He's so well of, he doesn't know what to spend his money on.
								</li>
								<li>
									If I were as well off as she is, I'd retire.
								</li>
								<li>
									Young people these days dont know how well off they are.
									</br>
									* Well off does not necessary have to refer to oney; it can also be used in respect of oppotunities, facilities, etc.
								</li>
								<li>
									He is far better off than I am.
									</br>
									* "Better off" is a comparative form of "well off"
									* However it can also be used to mean " It would be better for ..."
								</li>
								<li>
									You'd better off going the motorway than taking a country route, if you want to arrive there by 6 o'clock
								</li>
								<li>
									She's better off without her husband, he made her life a misery.
								</li>
								<li>
									I'd better fo now, I've got quite a few things to do.
									* "had better" is a stronger form of "should"
								</li>
								<li>
									Even though my brother has been working for quite a number of years, he is worse off than me.
									</br>* the opposite of "better off" is "worse off"
