						<h1> Task 1 (20 minutes, 150 words)</h1>
						<ol>
							<li>Analyse the Task and data: (2 minutes)
								</br>a: Is this a static data or movement data? What are the timescales? Compare the sizes and propotions or the changes in the figure over time?
								</br>b: What do the 2 axes show? What unit are shown? What tense to be used?
							</li>
							<li>Group the data: (3 minutes)
								</br>a: Find the similar/different group
								</br>b: Identify trends and exceptions: which pattern is common or shared by a group? which group behaves differently from the trend?
								</br>c: Select the main features using figures: only select the most noticeable figures in each group of data.
								</br><i>Avoid the mistake of simply listing the figures that you see in the charts. You should never describe the figures in sequence from left to right, or from top to bottom. You must show that you can group data, identify trends/exceptions and select key figures.</i>
							</li>
							<li> Writing the essay (15 minutes) 
								</br>a (1 minute): Write the introduction sentence: clear, single sentence that shows you have analysed and understood the data, timescales and units involved.
								</br><i>NOT include any figures or data (excep the years), NOT any background to the topic, NOT any knowledge, opinions or ideas of your own, NOT copy the complete Task instruction without changing/paraphrasing it</i>
								</br>b: main body: Explain the group trends, give selected figures, compare groups and explain exceptions.
								</br><i>1-3 paragraphs, careful on choosing tense: simple, present, past?</i>
								</br><i>Introduce trends:similarly, likewise, in the same way, a similar pattern or trend</i>
								</br><i>Introduce exceptions: however, by contrast, by comparison, conversely</i>
								</br>c: Writing the summary sentence and checking your work: 1-3 sentences. no any opinion, just data explain.
							    </br><i>In summary, to sum up, overall, to summarise</i>
							</li>

<h2>Topic 1</h2>
<h3>The first graph below shows the weight (in tonnes) of fruit produced by a farm during each month in
	2013, and also the amount (in tonnes) of fertiliser used. The second graph shows the volume of
	rainfall in each month (in millimetres.)
</h3>
<pre>
  The charts give information regarding the tonnage of fruite produced in a farm per month in 2013, the fertiliser used and the monthly rainfall in that year.
  We can see that fruit prodution rose steadily from just over 2 tonnes in January to a peak of roughly 4.2 tonnes by August. Output then fell rapidly, declining to around the initial 2 tonne mark in December. However, looking at fertiliser use, we see that this seasonal pattern is largely reversed: The most fertiliser (just under 1 tonne) was ultitilised in April, followed by a marked decline to zeor in June and July. Fertiliser consumption then incresed slightly in the autumn, rising to a total of around 0,7 tonnes before dipping to just below 0,5 tonnes at year end.
  Regarding rainfall, this appears to reflect the use of fertiliser, with an early high of 16mm in February, falling consistently to 4mm in July, August and September. Rainfall then increased steadily to reach 14mm in December.
  In summary, this farm generally employed the most fertiliser at seasons of high rainfall, and by constrast it produced the most fruit when whn rainfall and fertiliser use were around their lowest.

This essay would receive Band 9 in IELTS. The candidate gives a brief paraphrase of the Task introduction, and then deals with each chart in turn. He correctly identifies the trend in chart 1 (fruit increases as fertiliser decreases) and uses a small selection of figures to describe this, making it clear that he sees the trend (“this seasonal pattern is largely reversed. . .”) He makes it clear that he understands this is a ‘movement’ type Task by using the past simple to describe the changes, but he does not simply ‘list’ the sequence of figures in order. He identifies the second trend (fertiliser use follows rainfall levels) and selects key figures to emonstrate this. The summary reinforces the trend among the 3 elements (fruit, fertiliser and rainfall.) He correctly makes no attempt to explain or give reasons for the trends. Paragraphs are organised to follow the charts. The language used is clear and neutral, with no emotion or personal tone. The simple past is rightly used, because the year is shown (2013.) He makes it clear which charts he is discussing (“We can see . . . looking at . . . regarding”) and uses afacebook.com/ebook.sos variety of vocabulary to describe movements (decline/rise/dip/fall etc.) He uses marked/slightly/steadily/rapidly etc to show that he understands the rate of the changes. He uses phrases such as reversed and by contrast to emphasise the comparison of the patterns. The impression is of a candidate who has analysed the trends and selected key data to show that he understands them, without excessive detail.
